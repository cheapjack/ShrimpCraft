We use a permissive MIT license for the bits of code and tutorials we've packaged up and made here. The CloudMaker project, one pre-cursor for ShrimpCraft in general is about the putting together of existing IT tools to form a new utility.

Other components of the repo below have their own licensing and can be tracked back to their original source regarding this.

 * `mcpi` API from [Martin O'Hanlon](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi)
 * Adapted [Shrimping](http://shrimping.it) instructions and packaged parts
 * Arduino `OneWire` Library from [Paul Stoffregen](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html) also available from [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire) and on [github here](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire)
 * [CP2102 USB drivers](http://shrimping.it/drivers/cp2102/) courtesy of [Shrimping Project](http://shrimping.it) soon to be migrating to a [new website](http://start.shrimping.it/)
