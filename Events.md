Emerging from the research and work of Currently Shrimpcraft is a way of engaging with the public

**ShrimpCraft** is about using simple means and technology to explore the public's relationship to the sea. It's also about getting young people involved in computer science, technology ,basic elelectronics, gaming cultures like Minecraft and the natural world and realisng that all of these worlds can come together and that much of our contemporary technology in many ways has develped alongside our ability to live on and from the sea and the maritime world.

'Hands on' workshops provide a context to discuss and explore the maritime world and people's relationship to the sea.

###Walney Island

[Octopus Collective](http://www.octopuscollective.org/) hosted a beachcombing, sound walk and ddata collection week of work with Walney Primary School helping 

The children at Walney Primary School have a strong relationship to the sea and Walney Channel and see the importance of maritime engineering culture every day. Their town is also dominated economically by the presence of BAE Systems.

Many of the children talked of playing in and around the channel and were extremely comfortable on the Jetty and on the beach.

They had great enthusiasm for building their arduino sensor boards and took ownership of the simple floating sensors immeadiately and were thoroughly engaged with the whole process and was a very rewarding workshop.

###Liverpool Maritime Museum

Supported by National Museums Liverpool and Currently

Sarah Han of National Museums Liverpool [Maritime Museum](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/index.aspx) supported this **ShrimpCraft** event as part of the 2014 Maritime Museum Dockwatch programme.

 * ShrimpCraft Breadboard building and testing
 * Morse Code Flasher workshop
 * Greenwash Homemade Soap handling 
 * Watch LIVE the marine life of the Albert Dock using a submerged underwater camera
 * Samples of marine life caught from the dock and returned after the workshop
 * Sea squirters, Shrimp, crabs and prawns

The workshop took place on the dock side on a very busy Albert Dock weekend and felt like a mini festival of water exploration. We modelled the pop-up format on the show and tell style of events from the UK Maker culture and this friendly informal setup worked well.

Adrian McEwen and Ross Dalziel ran the shrimpcraft construction workshops building the sensor boards with families and then testing them in an aquarium. We were prevented from launching the sensors due to an unforeseen RedBull sponsored jetski event that perevented the us accessing the dock water safely.

This project continued into exploring marine communication with a local Beavers group in Garston where members earned their 'Communication Badge' through learning Morse code and sending it over a very simple Arduino based radio FM transmitter.

### [Do-It-Anyway festival](http://opensourcingfestivals.eu/events/do-it-anyway-festival-sheffield-uk)

[Access Space](http://access-space.org/)
We continued the ShrimpCraft events with Adrian McEwen, Amanda Steggel and Ross Dalziel for this festival of open source culture at Access Space a former collaborator with SoundNetwork and although effectively 'land-locked' nevertheless connected to a water bourne culture through the canal system that traverses the north of england beyond the Leeds Liverpool canal.

Access Space's commitment to DIY technology, self education, resilience meant this was a perfect context for using the ShrimpCraft project and helped push Ross Dalziel to start open sourcing the project using github
