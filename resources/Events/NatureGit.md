##"Nature on github: Technical communities in the landscape"

Lecture notes for Nature and Technology Symposium at [Metal](http://www.metalculture.com/about-us/liverpool/)

I'm generally interested in how technical communities form in and around technology so I've generated projects that work with

 * Amateur Astronomers
 * Canoeing clubs
 * Decap Organ Restorers 
 * Hackspaces
 * Nintendo DS Homebrewers
 * Planespotters
 * Sailors

Some technology in nature that inspires social technical collectives seem to be responses to the hostility of Nature:  
I've recently been studying for my Amateur Radio Foundation License with the [Southport & District Amateur Radio Club](http://www.sadarc.org.uk/) and found quite a few interesting sub-genres of radio enthusiasts.  

 * Amateur Radio Morse Coding Hill Walkers
 * [RAYNET](http://www.raynet-uk.net/) amateur radio resilience networks
 * Propogation Enthusiasts
 * [NVIS Near Vertical Incidence Skyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_vertical_incidence_skywave)

Technology in nature is always to do with resilience in a way; it comes from the basic idea that a tool helps humans interact and shape a hositle world; so it's inevitable that network culture should start to inhabit more and more extreme 'natural' habitats as part of it's narrative of a kind of 'militarisation' of human culture. Of course there are politics of power at play in this process of colonisation but that's maybe another discussion. 

I suppose we know what we think of when we say nature; we don't think 'city' but its worth thinking that cities ARE nature they're just nature with a high density of human tools..

There is now a CISCO Internet router in Space which I found out while researching [Delay Tolerant Networks](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/dtn/bundle.html) so I guess the drive for commercially inhabiting nature ever further is part of this.

Hopefully the complete colonisation of the network will include more open source approaches like [LoRa Alliance](https://www.lora-alliance.org/)

So I think its interesting how the internet of things is proliferating into society and culture: but it's been pretty much focussed on a city model but its already being used by everyone from the Environment Agency to Freshwater and Oceanography scientists and I think it's exciting for artists to get their hands on tools and data like that to perhaps critically engage with this area or looking at what we do with this kind of information.

In many ways alot of my work is about looking for a form of 'data literacy' in this field but perhaps more importantly theres a need to work out what to actually **do** with all this data: how to 'edit' data in the way someone like [Chris Watson](http://chriswatson.net/) does with sound.

How do we listen to data? In the way we listen to sound? I think there is something in developing ACTS and SITUATIONS FOR LISTENING TO DATA


Ive done a few projects that are related to nature and landscape like 
[Currently](http://currently.no) 

Currently came from a group of artists in Norway Amanda Steggel and Elizabeth Weihe who lived in and around sea-faring coastal communities and lived periodically on boats.

After several hack weekends with groups of artists and [journey from Oslo to Scotland](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&mid=zVYt5qa3Qe1o.kLCJ0-3vIjYA) we eventually developed **ShrimpCraft** a simple pop up workshop to use breadboard arduino's to measure water temperature and quality and visualise them in minecraft and processing

ShrimpCraft is built with [shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it/)

While designing public workshop tools for artists as they travelled by sea, canal and loch I also became generally interested in the idea of making and documenting tools for distributing my artistic practice. Tools for myself and then making them useful to others. This may be the direction I'd like Currently to go and we've recently made another tool for engaging with Tidal data, [Co-Tidal](https://github.com/cheapjack/Co-Tidal) 

It became pretty clear that making a tool for others is way harder than making one just for yourself and it really became clear that you cant make tools on your own and that you also need **other tools**

I also became interested in how you can use tools from technical communities to explore nature and especially how you can rapidly distribute and share tools through things like github. If Nature had a github account what would it do? It's a similar question we at **DoESLiverpool** asked for [code-for-liverpool](https://github.com/Liverpool-UK)

[Cockle-craft](https://github.com/mcqn/cocklecraft-of-things) is a WiFi version of ShrimpCraft built with Adrian McEwan

If it's possible to make resilient low power devices that can broadcast information about the natural world then artists could start making some interesting work out of it.

 * Invited the [FBA](http://www.fba.org.uk/) back to run an Easter Course
 * Make Easter course DIY water science kits
 * Make text adventures 
 * Learn morse code and the internet of things with [Furness Amateur Radio Society](http://www.fba.org.uk/)

I recently took part in Rod Dillon's [DEADWOOD](http://github.com/cheapjack/DeadWood) workshop at AND Festival and began thinking up an idea of using a gamejam format to help understand bacterial behaviour.

<h4 id="msbacman">A methodology for learning about the behaviour and communication of micro-organisms through modelling a game of pacman on a microscope slide.</h4>

We imagined making hacks of classic arcade games using different organisms behaviour to drive game mechanics and maybe use CNC and 3D extrusion printers to build physical environments to support this. It's a playful fun thing to do as much of game culture occupies a surprising amoung of people's cultural memory. 

But in terms of engineering and understanding, often games like pong and football manager are used as exercises in software engineering: perhaps we want to use them as exercises in wet-ware engineering

I'm also interested in how game engineering often uses advanced concepts in the sciences like [Game Of Life type algorithms](http://golly.sourceforge.net/) and [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)
