## Basic Activity plan

Adapt the [Shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it/project/memory/build.html#step10) [Memory Game](https://github.com/ShrimpingIt/projects/blob/master/sketchbook/shrimpingit/memory/Memory02MelodyGame/Memory02MelodyGame.ino) or the [Alarm Clock](start.shrimping.it/project/alarmclock/build.html) as a 'data logger' combined with some `SPI` writable [microSD Card Readers](http://r.ebay.com/qxbZUk) using this [Arduino Code](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ReadWrite) that can
be played back as flashing LEDs that help you playback and translate into a textile pattern.

Each reader uses ShrimpCraft light and temperature sensors to log analog readings and a generic logger that logs data from a dissolved Oxygen Sensor manually through button presses. This is written to the microSD card for playback and translation later.

Allow memory of 10 data points over time, say every 3 mins, so 30mins of time
Manually or automatically 'log' a data point to SD card.

At end of 30 min period LEDs can 'playback' the data points from the microSD card, advanced manually through a textile/wristband conveyor that allows participants to mark up their a piece of textile to graph our results over time for comparison and as a take away souvenir of workshop

This pattern is compared at the end on a wearable device like a T-Shirt
