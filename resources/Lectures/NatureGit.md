##"Nature on github: Technical communities in the landscape"

Lecture notes for Nature and Technology Symposium at [Metal](http://www.metalculture.com/about-us/liverpool/)

I'm generally interested in how technical communities form in and around technology so I've generated projects that work with

 * Amateur Astronomers
 * Canoeing clubs
 * Decap Organ Restorers 
 * Hackspaces
 * Nintendo DS Homebrewers
 * Planespotters
 * Sailors

Some technology in nature that inspires social technical collectives seem to be responses to the hostility of Nature:  
I've recently been studying for my Amateur Radio Foundation License with the [Southport & District Amateur Radio Club](http://www.sadarc.org.uk/) and found quite a few interesting sub-genres of enthusiasts 

 * Amateur Radio Morse Coding Hill Walkers
 * [RAYNET](http://www.raynet-uk.net/) amateur radio resilience networks
 * Propogation Enthusiasts
 * [NVIS Near Vertical Incidence Skyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_vertical_incidence_skywave)

Technology in nature is always to do with resilience in a way; it comes from the basic idea that a tool helps humans interact and shape a hositle world; so it's inevitable that network culture should start to inhabit more and more extreme 'natural' habitats. We know what we think of when we say nature; we don't think 'city' but its worth thinking that cities ARE nature they're just nature with a high density of human tools: but let's not get lost in semantics.

There is now a CISCO Internet router in Space which I found out while researching [Delay Tolerant Networks](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/dtn/bundle.html) so I guess the drive for commercially inhabiting nature ever further is part of this.

So I think its interesting how the internet of things is proliferating into society and culture: but it's been pretty much focussed on a city model but its already being used by everyone from the Environment Agency to Freshwater and Oceanography scientists and I think it's exciting for artists to get their hands on tools and data like that

Ive done a few projects that are related to nature and landscape 
[Currently](http://currently.no) 

Currently came from a group of artists in Norway Amanda Steggel and Elizabeth Weihe who lived in and around sea-faring coastal communities and lived periodically on boats.

After several hack weekends with groups of artists we eventually developed ShrimpCraft a simple pop up workshop to use breadboard arduino's to measure water temperature and quality and visualise them in minecraft and processing

ShrimpCraft is built with [shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it/)

While designing public workshop tools for artists as they travelled by sea, canal and loch I also became generally interested in the idea of making tools for artistic practice as part of my work. Tools for myself and then making them useful to others. This may be the direction I'd like Currently to go 

It became pretty clear that making a tool for others is way harder than making one just for yourself and it really became clear that you cant make tools on your own and that you also need **other tools**

I also became interested in how you can use tools from technical communities to explore nature and especially how you can rapidly distribute and share tools through things like github. If Nature had a github account what would it do?

[Cockle-craft](https://github.com/mcqn/cocklecraft-of-things) is a WiFi version of ShrimpCraft built with Adrian McEwan

If it's possible to make resilient low power devices that can broadcast information about the natural world then artists could start making some interesting work out of it.
