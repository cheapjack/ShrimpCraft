# Shrimp Assembly

This could not have happened without the committment to good documentation and strategic thinking about learning prototyping and physical computing of the [Shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it). Such is the impact of their work that the word 'Shrimping' has become synonymous with breadboarding arduino projects for many in the maker community.

Follow MoT1-MoT3 and then CompleteTemperatureSensor and/or CompleteTurbiditySensor in either `.svg` or `.pdf` format. There also cut files for the 3mm Plastazote foam that we used to support and blackout the turbidity samples.

There's also a shrimp schematic that shows you what all the arduino pins do.

We also highly recommend following [Shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it) instructions for getting started with the [Blink Sketch](http://start.shrimping.it/project/blink/build.html); they have the most up to date instructions and provide ready bagged kits that we use for the ShrimpCraft project. Please donate to their project by using their kit and spreading the word about learning by 'Shrimping'.
