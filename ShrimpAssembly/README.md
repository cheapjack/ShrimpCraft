# Shrimp Assembly

Follow MoT1-MoT3 and then CompleteTemperatureSensor and/or CompleteTurbiditySensor in either `.svg` or `.pdf` format. There also cut files for the 3mm Plastazote foam that we used to support and blackout the turbidity samples.

There's also a shrimp schematic that shows you what all the arduino pins do.
