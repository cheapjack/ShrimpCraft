### How To

Follow the instructions in the files `MoT1`-`MoT3` files in `.svg` or `.pdf` format and then `CompleteTemperatureSensor` and/or `CompleteTurbiditySensor` in either `.svg` or `.pdf` format. You can also find cut files for the 3mm Plastazote foam that we used to support and blackout the turbidity samples.

There's also a shrimp schematic that shows you what all the arduino pins do and it's a really good reference

We also highly recommend following [Shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it) instructions for getting started with the [Blink Sketch](http://start.shrimping.it/project/blink/build.html) and then you can continue to build a protected shrimp that stops you killing your `ATMEGA328` chip or having noisy analog ins.

### Thanks

This could not have happened without the committment to good documentation and strategic thinking about learning prototyping and physical computing of the [Shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it) team. Such is the impact of their work that the word 'Shrimping' has become synonymous with breadboarding arduino projects for many in the maker community.

[Shrimping.it](http://start.shrimping.it) have the most up to date instructions and provide the ready bagged kits that we use and adapt for the ShrimpCraft project. Please donate to their project by using their kit and spreading the word about learning by 'Shrimping'.

Once you've made a shrimp you'll never want to buy an arduino board again. We are developing a breadboard Internet of Things(IoT) kit using the popular ESP8266 ESP12 WiFi Module with [Adrian McEwen](http://www.mcqn.com/) which is currently using a Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing development breakout board while we work out the best components hopefully with some help from the Shrimping.it team.

It's called the [cocklecraft-of-things](https://github.com/mcqn/cocklecraft-of-things) after Merseyside cockles instead of Morecambe shrimps.

Thanks Cefn and all the Shrimping.it team and of course `mcqn`
