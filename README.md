# ShrimpCraft

##Prototype Kits for Shrimped Arduino sensor boards and code

**ShrimpCraft** is a project initialised from [Amanda Steggell](http://www.testingtesting.org/) and [Ross Dalziels](http://cheapjack.org.uk] project, [Currently](http:/currently.no) to introduce young people to DIY water sensing with basic electronics. 

It uses the *brilliant* **Shrimped Arduino kits** from [Shrimping.it](http://shrimping.it/blog/) at its core and also features prototype methods for visualising data on onboard LED flashers, in Processing and in Minecraft using the [mcpi API](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi) and the [FACT](http://fact.co.uk) [Minecraft CloudMaker Server](http://mc.fact.co.uk:8123/)

It has been run as a pop up workshops at
Walney Primary School Walney Island, Cumbria with [Octopus Collective](http://www.octopuscollective.org)
Liverpool Maritime Museum
[Do-It-Anyway festival](http://opensourcingfestivals.eu/events/do-it-anyway-festival-sheffield-uk)

**Note** These files are in progress, particularly the .pdf instructions that need checking and revising
