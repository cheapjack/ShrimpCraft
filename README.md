##Prototype Kits for Shrimped Arduino sensor boards and code

**ShrimpCraft** is a project initialised from [Amanda Steggell](http://www.testingtesting.org/) and [Ross Dalziel's](http://cheapjack.org.uk) project, [Currently](http:/currently.no) to introduce young people to DIY water sensing with basic electronics. In this case the kits measure temperature with a **DS1820 Water Proof Temperature Sensor** and a DIY turbidity sensor

It uses the *brilliant* **Shrimped Arduino kits** from [Shrimping.it](http://shrimping.it/blog/) at its core and also features prototype methods for visualising data on onboard LED flashers, in Processing and in Minecraft using a modified version of Martin O'Hanlon's [mcpi API](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi) and the [FACT](http://fact.co.uk) [Minecraft CloudMaker Server](http://mc.fact.co.uk:8123/)

###Background

It's part of [The Minecraft Of Things](http://minecraftofthings.tumblr.com) which sprang from research with FACT, Mark Wright, Adrian McEwen and Paul Harter funded by AHRC for the [CloudMaker](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/cloudmaker-making-minecraft-real.aspx) project

###Open Source?

The project is essentially about data, software and hardware literacy in the context of doing and exploring our relationship to Water.

This is in the spirit of open source alhtough elements used are not strictly open source. ; 

 * Minecraft is not open source but has a large modding culture and are famously vague about IP. You have to buy the game basically to play most servers. This project however is based on the use of [Minecraft Pi Edition](http://pi.minecraft.net/?page_id=14) which is free to download and use and initiated by Mojang but maintained by the Minecraft and [Raspberry Pi](http://elinux.org/RPi_Hub) community
 * Processing is used under a GPL license
 * `mcpi` is an API for Minecraft Pi Edition, released under an MIT License and is maintained by Martin O'Hanlon's [Stuff About Code](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html) project.
 * [Shrimping.it](http://shrimping.it/blog/) is open source even if some components may not be and also clearly about pedagogy and technological literacy which is reflected in their views on [Breadboards](http://shrimping.it/blog/why-no-pcbs/)
