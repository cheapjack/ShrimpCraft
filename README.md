##Prototype Kits for Shrimped Arduino sensor boards and code

**ShrimpCraft** is a project initialised from [Amanda Steggell](http://www.testingtesting.org/) and [Ross Dalziel's](http://cheapjack.org.uk) project, [Currently](http:/currently.no) to introduce young people to DIY water sensing with basic electronics. In this case the kits measure temperature with a **DS1820 Water Proof Temperature Sensor** and a DIY turbidity sensor

It uses the *brilliant* **Shrimped Arduino kits** from [Shrimping.it](http://shrimping.it/blog/) at its core and also features prototype methods for visualising data on onboard LED flashers, in Processing and in Minecraft using a modified version of Martin O'Hanlon's [mcpi API](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi) and the [FACT](http://fact.co.uk) [Minecraft CloudMaker Server](http://mc.fact.co.uk:8123/)

###Background

It's part of [The Minecraft Of Things](http://minecraftofthings.tumblr.com) which sprang from research with FACT, Mark Wright, Adrian McEwen and Paul Harter funded by AHRC for the [CloudMaker](http://www.fact.co.uk/projects/cloudmaker-making-minecraft-real.aspx) project

###Workshops

It has been run as pop up workshops for families and children at
 * Walney Primary School, Walney Island, Cumbria with [Octopus Collective](http://www.octopuscollective.org)
 * Liverpool Maritime Museum
 * [Do-It-Anyway festival](http://opensourcingfestivals.eu/events/do-it-anyway-festival-sheffield-uk) at [Access Space](http://access-space.org/)
